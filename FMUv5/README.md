# FMUv5 Pixhawk Open Hardware Design

FMUv5 was released in 2018. When compared to previous versions it has a new processor, 2xRAM, new sensors with higher temperature stability, and is much more configurable. 
More information can be found in the [Pixhawk4 Data Sheet](Pixhawk4-Data-Sheet.pdf).

> **Tip** General information about designs, schematics, reference hardware, FMU versions, licensing, and trademarks can be found in the repo [README](../README.md).


## Design Files

The FMUv5 reference design pinout is available [on Google docs here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-n0__BYDedQrc_2NHqBenG1DNepAgnHpSGglke-QQwY/edit#gid=912976165) (linked from [FMUv5_stm32_pinout.md](FMUv5_stm32_pinout.md)).
This includes everything needed to create compatible hardware.

Note
